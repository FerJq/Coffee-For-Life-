            <h4>sAbout coffee üìö</h4>
            <p>
              The history of coffee dates back across centuries of old oral
              tradition. Coffee plants grew wild in Yemen and were widely used
              by nomadic tribes for thousands of years. Sufi monasteries in
              Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers.
              Roasting the seeds was not a way to serve coffee until the
              1400s.

            <h4>Coffee in Western Europeüåç</h4>
            <p>
              Coffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the
              late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. In many
              cultures, if you could afford to serve coffee to your guests, it
              was a sign of wealth and power. One of the earliest cultivations
              of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought
              coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted
              18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean
              islands like Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788,
              Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee.

            <h4>Coffee Production ‚òï</h4>

            <p>
              By 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest producer of coffee
              and has held that status ever since. The period since 1950 saw the
              widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several
              other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia,
              and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the
              second-largest producer in 1999.[2] Modern production techniques
              along with the mass productization of coffee has made it a
              household item today.

          The cool thing about coffee beans is that it‚Äôs a gift you can enjoy
          alongside the person who‚Äôs receiving. You can tell them about the
          beans, why you picked them, and what makes them special.
